# Dungeon Game (Text-Based Adventure)

This folder contains versions of a text-based dungeon crawler created to explore Python fundamentals such as dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and basic game state management.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to progressively improve a Python-based text adventure game. The player navigates through rooms, collects artifacts, and ultimately confronts a final boss.

## Folder Structure

- `legacy/` â€“ Contains early milestone versions of the dungeon game.
- Future versions will be added outside the `legacy/` folder as the project is rebuilt with improved design and features.
