# Legacy Versions – Dungeon Game

This folder contains early milestone versions of the text-based dungeon game.  These scripts were created to practice core Python concepts and are preserved here as part of the project’s evolution.

## Files Included

- `legacy_dungeon_game_v1.py`: The original simplified prototype with three rooms and basic directional input.
- `legacy_dungeon_game_v2.py`: A more developed version with a map of multiple rooms, auto-inventory system, artifact collection, and endgame conditions.

## Notes

These versions are not polished or optimized but represent important progress milestones. A more refined and modular version is planned for future development.
