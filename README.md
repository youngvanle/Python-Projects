- Functions and dictionaries
- Modular structure and text-based interactions

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `lab_practices/` â€“ A collection of small Python exercises focused on logic, formatting, and syntax mastery.

## âœ… Notes

- All scripts follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) naming conventions.
